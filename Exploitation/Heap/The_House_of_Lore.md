Welcome to the House of Lore
This is a revisited version that bypass also the hardening check introduced by glibc malloc
This is tested against Ubuntu 14.04.4 - 32bit - glibc-2.23

Allocating the victim chunk
Allocated the first small chunk on the heap at 0x804c008
```

0x804c000 영역에 malloc으로 100만큼 할당 <- victim

```
gdb-peda$ x/24wx 0x804c000
0x804c000:	0x00000000	0x00000069	0x00000000	0x00000000
```

Stack 영역에 Fake Chunk를 만들기 위한 Buffer 확인

```
stack_buffer_1 at 0xffffd58c
stack_buffer_2 at 0xffffd580
Create a fake chunk on the stack
Set the fwd pointer to the victim_chunk in order to bypass the check of small bin corruptedin second to the last malloc, which putting stack address on smallbin list
Set the bk pointer to stack_buffer_2 and set the fwd pointer of stack_buffer_2 to point to stack_buffer_1 in order to bypass the check of small bin corrupted in last malloc, which returning pointer to the fake chunk on stack
```

p5에 malloc으로 1000만큼 할당  
free 시 top chunk와 병합되지 않도록 large chunk를 만든다.

```
Allocating another large chunk in order to avoid consolidating the top chunk withthe small one during the free()
Allocated the large chunk on the heap at 0x804c070

Freeing the chunk 0x804c008, it will be inserted in the unsorted bin
```

victim을 Free 한 후의 heapinfo  
unsortbin에 victim이 들어간 것을 확인할 수 있다.

```
gdb-peda$ heapinfo
(0x10)     fastbin[0]: 0x0
(0x18)     fastbin[1]: 0x0
(0x20)     fastbin[2]: 0x0
(0x28)     fastbin[3]: 0x0
(0x30)     fastbin[4]: 0x0
(0x38)     fastbin[5]: 0x0
(0x40)     fastbin[6]: 0x0
(0x48)     fastbin[7]: 0x0
(0x50)     fastbin[8]: 0x0
(0x58)     fastbin[9]: 0x0
                  top: 0x804c458 (size : 0x20ba8) 
       last_remainder: 0x0 (size : 0x0) 
            unsortbin: 0x804c000 (size : 0x68)
```

unsortbin victim's fwd오 bk는 nil이다.

```
In the unsorted bin the victim's fwd and bk pointers are nil
victim->fwd: 0xf7fb67b0
victim->bk: 0xf7fb67b0
```

```
Now performing a malloc that can't be handled by the UnsortedBin, nor the small bin
This means that the chunk 0x804c008 will be inserted in front of the SmallBin
```

p2에 1200만큼 malloc 후 heapinfo  
smallbin에 victim이 삽입되었다.

```
gdb-peda$ heapinfo
(0x10)     fastbin[0]: 0x0
(0x18)     fastbin[1]: 0x0
(0x20)     fastbin[2]: 0x0
(0x28)     fastbin[3]: 0x0
(0x30)     fastbin[4]: 0x0
(0x38)     fastbin[5]: 0x0
(0x40)     fastbin[6]: 0x0
(0x48)     fastbin[7]: 0x0
(0x50)     fastbin[8]: 0x0
(0x58)     fastbin[9]: 0x0
                  top: 0x804c910 (size : 0x206f0) 
       last_remainder: 0x0 (size : 0x0) 
            unsortbin: 0x0
(0x068)  smallbin[11]: 0x804c000
```

```
The chunk that can't be handled by the unsorted bin, nor the SmallBin has been allocated to 0x804c460
The victim chunk has been sorted and its fwd and bk pointers updated
victim->fwd: 0xf7fb6810
victim->bk: 0xf7fb6810

Now emulating a vulnerability that can overwrite the victim->bk pointer
```

victim을 다시 한 번 free하여 bk 영역에 stack_buffer_1으로 변조한다.

```
gdb-peda$ x/24wx 0x804c000
0x804c000:	0x00000000	0x00000069	0xf7fb6810	0xffffd58c <- stack_buffer_1
```

```               
-------> -------- victim chunk(0x804c000) --------- 
|        |                   |                    |
|        |         fd        | bk(stack_buffer_1) |----
|        ------------------------------------------   |
|                                                     |
|   ---------------------------------------------------
|   |
|   ----> -------- stack_buffer_1(0xffffd58c) -------
|   |     |        0x0         |         0x0        |
----|-----|  fd(victim_chunk)  | bk(stack_buffer_2) |----
    |     -------------------------------------------   |
    |                                                   |
    | ---------------------------------------------------                     
    | |
    | --> -------- stack_buffer_2(0xffffd580) ------- 
    |     |                     |                   | 
    ------|  fd(stack_buffer_1) |                   |
          -------------------------------------------
```

victim과 똑같은 size로 malloc한다.

```
Now allocating a chunk with size equal to the first one freed
This should return the overwritten victim chunk and set the bin->bk to the injected victim->bk pointer
```

0x804c000 영역이 할당되었다.

```
gdb-peda$ x/24wx 0x804c000
0x804c000:	0x00000000	0x00000069	0xf7fb6810	0xffffd58c
```

다시 한 번 똑같은 size로 malloc할 경우 Stack의 공간이 할당된다. (0xffffd594)  
jackot의 주소를 변수에 저장 후 p4 + 40 위치에 memcpy할 경우 Return Address가 변조되어 jackpot이 실행된다.

```
This last malloc should trick the glibc malloc to return a chunk at the position injected in bin->bk
p4 = malloc(100)
The fwd pointer of stack_buffer_2 has changed after the last malloc to 0xf7fb6810
p4 is 0xffffd594 and should be on the stack!
Nice jump d00d
```
