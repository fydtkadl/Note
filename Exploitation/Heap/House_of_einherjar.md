* a에 malloc(0x38) 할당

Welcome to House of Einherjar!
Tested in Ubuntu 16.04 64bit.
This technique only works with disabled tcache-option for glibc, see build_glibc.sh for build instructions.
This technique can be used when you have an off-by-one into a malloc'ed region with a null byte.

We allocate 0x38 bytes for 'a'
a: 0x603010
Since we want to overflow 'a', we need the 'real' size of 'a' after rounding: 0x38
```

* Stack에 Fake chunk 생성

```
We create a fake chunk wherever we want, in this case we'll create the chunk on the stack
However, you can also create the chunk in the heap or the bss, as long as you know its address
We set our fwd and bck pointers to point at the fake_chunk in order to pass the unlink checks
(although we could do the unsafe unlink technique here in some scenarios)
Our fake chunk at 0x7fffffffe4b0 looks like:
prev_size (not used): 0x100
size: 0x100
fwd: 0x7fffffffe4b0
bck: 0x7fffffffe4b0
fwd_nextsize: 0x7fffffffe4b0
```

* Fake chunk 

```
gdb-peda$ x/24gx 0x7fffffffe4b0
0x7fffffffe4b0:	0x0000000000000100	0x0000000000000100
0x7fffffffe4c0:	0x00007fffffffe4b0	0x00007fffffffe4b0
0x7fffffffe4d0:	0x00007fffffffe4b0	0x00007fffffffe4b0
```

* b의 metadata인 size에서 "prev_inuse" flag를 해제

```
We allocate 0xf8 bytes for 'b'.
b: 0x603050
b.size: 0x101
b.size is: (0x100) | prev_inuse = 0x101
We overflow 'a' with a single null byte into the metadata of 'b'
b.size: 0x100
This is easiest if b.size is a multiple of 0x100 so you don't change the size of b, only its prev_inuse bit
If it had been modified, we would need a fake chunk inside b where it will try to consolidate the next chunk
```

* b의 size, "prev_inuse" flag가 해제되어 병합이 일어난다.

```
gdb-peda$ x/24gx 0x603040
0x603040:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000100 <-
```

* b의 "prev_size"에 b - fake chunk 한 값을 입력한다.

```
We write a fake prev_size to the last 8 bytes of a so that it will consolidate with our fake chunk
Our fake prev_size will be 0x603040 - 0x7fffffffe4b0 = 0xffff800000604b90
```

* fake_size

```
gdb-peda$ x/gx $rbp-0x50
0x7fffffffe4a0:	0xffff800000604b90
```

* fake chunk의 size를  fake_size로 변조한다.

```
Modify fake chunk's size to reflect b's new prev_size
```

```
gdb-peda$ x/24gx 0x7fffffffe4b0
0x7fffffffe4b0:	0x0000000000000100	0xffff800000604b90 <-
0x7fffffffe4c0:	0x00007fffffffe4b0	0x00007fffffffe4b0
0x7fffffffe4d0:	0x00007fffffffe4b0	0x00007fffffffe4b0
```

* free b
* b의 "prev_inuse"가 해제되어 있어 b와 fake chunk가 병합된다.

```
Now we free b and this will consolidate with our fake chunk since b prev_inuse is not set
Our fake chunk size is now 0xffff800000625b51 (b.size + fake_prev_size)

```

* free b 후 heapinfo

```
gdb-peda$ heapinfo
(0x20)     fastbin[0]: 0x0
(0x30)     fastbin[1]: 0x0
(0x40)     fastbin[2]: 0x0
(0x50)     fastbin[3]: 0x0
(0x60)     fastbin[4]: 0x0
(0x70)     fastbin[5]: 0x0
(0x80)     fastbin[6]: 0x0
(0x90)     fastbin[7]: 0x0
(0xa0)     fastbin[8]: 0x0
(0xb0)     fastbin[9]: 0x0
                  top: 0x7fffffffe4b0 (size : 0xffff800000625b50) (top is broken ?) 
       last_remainder: 0x0 (size : 0x0) 
            unsortbin: 0x0
```

* 다음 malloc 시 Stack 영역에 할당된다.

```
Now we can call malloc() and it will begin in our fake chunk
Next malloc(0x200) is at 0x7fffffffe4c0
```

```
gdb-peda$ x/24gx 0x7fffffffe4c0-0x10
0x7fffffffe4b0:	0x0000000000000100	0x0000000000000211
0x7fffffffe4c0:	0x00007fffffffe4b0	0x00007fffffffe4b0
```
